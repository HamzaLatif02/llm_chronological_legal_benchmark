    "answer": "No, the Work and Families Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 and the Highway Act 1835 are two completely different types of legislation that cover entirely different areas of law and do not overlap. \n\nThe Work and Families Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 is related to employment rights, parental leave, and flexible working arrangements in Northern Ireland, while the Highway Act 1835 is an older piece of legislation dealing with highways and road management in the United Kingdom.\n\nThese acts address different legal domains and would not typically be considered as overlapping.",
    "answer_with_dates": "Let me help you analyze this carefully:\n\n1. Work and Families Act (Northern Ireland) 2015:\n• Start date: 2015-01-08\n• End date: 2025-07-01\n\n2. Highway Act 1835:\n• Start date: 2025-07-31\n• End date: 2025-07-01\n\nTo determine if these periods overlap, I'll compare their date ranges:\n• The Work and Families Act ends on 2025-07-01\n• The Highway Act starts on 2025-07-31\n\nThese dates do NOT overlap. In fact, the Highway Act starts AFTER the Work and Families Act has already ended.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: No, the Work and Families Act is NOT overlapped by the Highway Act."

    "answer": "I apologize, but I cannot determine if these two acts overlap based on their titles alone. To accurately assess whether there is an overlap between the Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 and the Commons Registration (East Sussex) Act 1994, I would need to review the full text and specific provisions of both acts. These acts appear to cover different subject matters (employment law in Northern Ireland and commons registration in East Sussex), but without detailed examination, I cannot definitively state whether they have any overlapping provisions.",
    "answer_with_dates": "To determine if these two acts overlap, I'll compare their date ranges:\n\n1. Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 2010:\n   - Start date: 2010-08-02\n   - End date: 2025-07-01\n\n2. Commons Registration (East Sussex) Act 1994:\n   - Start date: 1994-07-05\n   - End date: 2025-07-01\n\nComparing the dates:\n- The Commons Registration (East Sussex) Act 1994 starts before the Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 2010\n- Both acts have the same end date of 2025-07-01\n\nSince the Commons Registration (East Sussex) Act 1994 begins before the Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 and they share the same end date, they do overlap.\n\nSo the answer is: Yes, the Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 is overlapped by the Commons Registration (East Sussex) Act 1994."

    "answer": "No, these two acts do not overlap. They deal with entirely different areas of law:\n\n1. United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 is a UK-wide legislation that primarily deals with economic and trade regulations following Brexit, focusing on maintaining a smooth internal market across the UK's nations.\n\n2. Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 is a Scottish law specifically addressing legal protections and rights related to matrimonial homes in Scotland.\n\nThese acts cover completely different legal domains and have no direct overlap in their scope or purpose.",
    "answer_with_dates": "To determine if these two acts overlap, I'll compare their date ranges:\n\nUnited Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020:\nStart: 2020-12-17\nEnd: 2024-02-21\n\nMatrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981:\nStart: 1981-10-30\nEnd: 2025-04-23\n\nComparing these dates, we can see that the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 falls entirely within the date range of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981.\n\nTherefore, yes, the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 is overlapped by the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981."
